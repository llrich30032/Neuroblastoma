            <p>Let me introduce you to Taylor Borden.</p>
            <p>Taylor Borden was born on August 28, 2013 and soon after she was diagnosed with Turner syndrome in </p>
            <p>June 2014. On September 17, 2015, 2 year old Taylor Borden was diagnosed with Stage 4 Neuroblastoma. . . .</p>

           <!--About Taylor's journey-->
           <div>
            <p class="about">A month prior to her diagnosis, Taylor began falling and had difficulties with her balance and equilibrium. Initially, the doctor's thought that she was having complications due to her Turner syndrome, but after performing an MRI it was found that Taylor had 4 malignant tumors in various parts of her body. The most complicated mass was found on her spinal cord, measuring from T4-T9. The next growth was found in her abdominal cavity measuring the size of a baseball, the third was found in her chest and the fourth was found on her hip. Taylor's family was informed that aggressive treatments should begin immediately. So after her diagnosis, Taylor was transferred to The Blair E. Batson Hospital for Children in Jackson, MS to begin treatments. The day of admission, Taylor was marked for her radiation, had a chemport placed, and the following day begin her first round of chemotherapy.

Taylor has demonstrated enormous bravery in the face of the chemo treatments and continuous hospital admissions. She has a great team of doctors and nurses that are dedicated to treating her Neuroblastoma. She is presently going through chemotherapy to reduce the size of the tumors, with hopes to shrink them down enough for surgery. She smiles and laughs during her hospital visits, and together with her family is just living life the best they can and taking it one day at a time.

The family and all involved with Taylor's care, appreciate all the help, prayers and support through this experience.</p>
